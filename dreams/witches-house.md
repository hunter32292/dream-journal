A mother and her two daughters are in a house, they somehow came to be staying in the house. While one of the girls play in the upstairs bedroom, she comes across a hidden panel that slides back. The panel reveals a staircase with brick walls, cobwebs, and wooden paneling running along the brick. She runs to find her mother after a gust of wind from the direction of the staircase brings a shiver to her. After finding her mother who is with her sister they go upstairs to see the hidden staircase, the lights in the room are out in that room only. After walking into that room and the mother seeing the staircase the mother see's a vision. Two women standing in a green glow room, with a large wooden table covered in jars of miscalanious plants, anmial parts, human parts, and a row of books on a shelf. They're fighting about something related to one of the books, one of the women takes the book down and the mother can see that it has a large red circle with a line running down it until it reaches the end of the circle and goes down slightly farther. The one women seems angry about the book, while the other is calm and pointing away. As the vision stops the room begins to shake, the mother realizes she was standing there not moving and the little girls are pulling at her. She grabs the two little girls and starts to leave the room, but as she does the little girl who had found the hidden pannel is pulled away from her and dragged to the center of the room. As she is Screaming a trap door in the center of the room drops out and her voice fades as she falls down.
