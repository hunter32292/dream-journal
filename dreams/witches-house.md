A mother and her two daughters are in a house, they're staying in the house for a while. The younger daughter is playing in the upstairs bedroom, she comes across a hidden panel in the wall that slides back. The panel reveals a staircase with brick walls, cobwebs, and wood paneling running along the brick walls. She runs downstairs to find her mother after a gust of cool wind from the direction of the staircase begins to make her shiver. After finding her mother who is with her sister all of them go upstairs to see the hidden staircase, the lights in only this room have gone out. After walking into that room, the mother sees the staircase and suddenly she sees a vision.

Two women are standing in a room with a sickly green glow. A large wooden table covered in jars of miscellaneous plants, animal parts and human parts sits in the center of the room. A small shelf with a row of books is against the wall that the women are standing next to. One of the women is yelling about something, the yelling women takes a book down and the mother can see that it has a large red circle with a line running down it. The one woman seems angry about the book, while the other is calm and pointing away towards the other end of the room. As the vision stops the room begins to shake, the mother realizes she was standing there not moving, the little girls are pulling at her and crying. She grabs the two little girls and starts to leave the room, but as she does the little girl who had found the hidden panel is pulled out of her hand and dragged to the center of the room. As the little girl screams a trap door in the center of the room drops out and her voice fades as she falls.
